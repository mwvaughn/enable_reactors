# Enable Reactors

Upgrade any Ubuntu 14-16 Docker container image to be use TACC Reactors and Agave application runtimes. This installer replicates the steps we use to build the [Ubuntu base image][1] `abacosamples/base-ubu`. It's preferable to start with our base if starting code development from scratch to keep container sizes in line and minimize dependency wierdness.
